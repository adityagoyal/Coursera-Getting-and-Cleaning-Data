<bold>Files in this repo<br/></bold>

UCI HAR Dataset folder -- contains train and test and feature dataset.<br/>
README.md -- you are reading it right now<br/>
codebook.md -- codebook for the repo<br/>
run_analysis.R -- actual R code<br/>
merged_data.txt -- merged data<br/>
data_with_means.txt -- tidy dataset with average of each variable for each activity and subject<br/>

run_analysis.R results in two files:-<br/>
1)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. <br/> 
3)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. <br/> 
4)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  <br/> 
merged_data.txt contains merged data. <br/> 
5)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. <br/> 
data_with_means.txt contains tidy dataset with average of each variable for each activity and subject. <br/>
